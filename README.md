# Koa Cluster

Lightweight, opinionated clustering for Koa apps.
Use this if you don't want the complexity of other process managers.

## Usage

```bash
koa-cluster app.js
```

## Koa App

You must export your Koa app like:

```js
var app = module.exports = koa()
```

Make sure you don't create a `http` server yourself.
Don't call `app.listen()`.
This will handle it automatically.

### Check Continue

This automatically utilizes the `checkContinue` event.
You should handle this wherever appropriate in your Koa app:

```js
app.use(function* () {
  if (this.req.checkContinue) this.res.writeContinue();
  var body = yield parse(this);
})
```

### Settings

Custom settings are checked on the `app` that aren't part of Koa.
You can set them however you'd like.
These settings are:

- `name` - your app's name
- `port`
- `hostname`
- `maxHeadersCount`
- `timeout`
